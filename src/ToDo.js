/*
when clicking add post button -
    - it should create a pop up that is over everything instead of go to a new page
    - same thing with viewing single post. 

figure out whether to edit posts on new page

-make react run quicker / less API calls and only run on certain triggers
    -- look into useCallback/useMemo other things

    //make sure all accent colors match the original color scheme. 
    i.e. input borders, fonts, etc
